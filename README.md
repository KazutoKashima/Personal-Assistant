# What is Red Alice Rising?
Besides a bad name for a virtual assistant called Alice? Not much at the moment, currently I'm working on the basic text input, next is "memory," and then speech, then finally, more advanced computer controlling!

# What languages are being used?
Solely right now is just Python, if the need rises I may use things like C# or JavaScript but I'm trying to keep it as close to Python-Only as possible

# How often will you update it?
Between work and schooling? *I'll try at least 1-2 every couple of weeks, maybe someone from the crowd could help?*

# How do I download it?
Currently I haven't compiled it yet, so you need python 3.6 or later and to [download the zip](https://github.com/KazutoKashima/Project-Red-Alice-Rising/archive/master.zip) and extract the file before you can run it in python. *sorry 'bout that!*
