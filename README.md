# What is Red Alice Rising?
Besides a bad name for a virtual assistant called Alice? Not much at the moment, currently I'm working on the basic text input, next is "memory," and then speech, then finally, more advanced computer controlling!

# What languages are being used?
Solely, right now is just Python. If the need rises I may use things like C# or JavaScript but I'm trying to keep it as close to Python-Only as possible

# How often will you update it?
Between work and schooling? I'll try at least 1-2 every couple of weeks, *maybe someone from the crowd could help?*

# How do I download it?
Currently I haven't compiled it yet, so you need python 3.6 or later and to [download the zip](https://github.com/KazutoKashima/Project-Red-Alice-Rising/archive/master.zip) and extract the file before you can run it in python. *sorry 'bout that!*

# I'm getting dependency (import) errors
Open up your terminal/CMD `cd` into where you saved the code, run `pip install requirements.txt` and  double click on `pywin320228.win-amd64-py3.8.exe` if you have Python 3.8 or `pywin320228.win-amd64-py3.9.exe` if you have 3.9.  
Once that's completed run `pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl` to install PyAudio. After it's all installed, run the code located in `src` by right clicking and selecting `Edit with IDLE` and press `F5`. It should run fine from then on.
