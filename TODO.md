### What's left to do?
----------------------
1. Voice Input - Threading
2. Deeper Memory Function
3. Voice Recognition

### Suggestions?
----------------
- Seperate the commands into a seperate file
- Let the user choose Voice or Text input within the app

+-> Change with hotkeys,too
- Customise the Assistant's name

### Bugs
1. `Threading in Speech.py is erroring out, unsure of why that is`
2. `"learn" isn't adding the definition to the "newWords.log" file`
